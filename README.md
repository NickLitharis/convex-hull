# Convex Hull Algorithms Playground

Welcome! This project lets you explore and compare different convex hull algorithms, each using a different sorting method. You can generate random points, compute their convex hull, and visualize the results‚Äîall with simple commands.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Convex_Hull_Bubble_Sort.cpp**  
  Convex hull with Bubble Sort (easy to understand, not the fastest).
- **Convex_Hull_Selection_Sort.cpp**  
  Convex hull with Selection Sort (simple and educational).
- **Convex_Hull_Merge_Sort.cpp**  
  Convex hull with Merge Sort (efficient for large datasets).
- **Convex_Hull_Quick_Sort.cpp**  
  Convex hull with Quick Sort (fast and popular).
- **visualize.py**  
  Python script to plot your points and hull for easy viewing.
- **points_and_hull.csv**  
  Automatically generated file with all points and hull coordinates.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

### 1. Build the Programs

Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like `g++`).  
Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
g++ Convex_Hull_Bubble_Sort.cpp -o Convex_Hull_Bubble_Sort
g++ Convex_Hull_Selection_Sort.cpp -o Convex_Hull_Selection_Sort
g++ Convex_Hull_Merge_Sort.cpp -o Convex_Hull_Merge_Sort
g++ Convex_Hull_Quick_Sort.cpp -o Convex_Hull_Quick_Sort
```

---

### 2. Run an Algorithm

Each program generates random points and computes their convex hull.  
You can choose how many points to use:

- **Default (100 points):**
  ```bash
  ./Convex_Hull_Bubble_Sort
  ```
- **Custom (e.g., 500 points):**
  ```bash
  ./Convex_Hull_Bubble_Sort 500
  ```

The program will print the time taken (in nanoseconds) and create `points_and_hull.csv` for visualization.

---

### 3. Visualize the Results

See your points and hull in a plot!  
First, make sure you have Python 3 and these packages:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas
```

Then run:

```bash
python3 visualize.py
```

A window will pop up showing your points (blue) and the convex hull (red).
