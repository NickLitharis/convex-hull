# Convex Hull Algorithms and Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project implements and compares four different sorting algorithms—Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort—in the context of computing the Convex Hull of a set of points in 2D space. The Convex Hull represents the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the given points.

In this README, we will discuss the implemented algorithms, how to run the project, and the results of a performance analysis comparing the execution times of each algorithm.

## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**: This simple sorting algorithm repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues until no swaps are needed.

2. **Merge Sort**: Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and repeatedly merging sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

3. **Quick Sort**: Quick Sort is an efficient, in-place, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

4. **Selection Sort**: Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the end of the sorted sublist.


## Conclusion
This project showcases the implementation and comparison of four sorting algorithms—Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort—in the context of computing the Convex Hull. It allows you to explore the trade-offs between different sorting algorithms and their impact on computational efficiency.

Feel free to contribute to the project, provide feedback, or experiment with different input datasets to further analyze the algorithms' performance.
